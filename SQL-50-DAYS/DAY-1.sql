-- Your challenge is to construct an SQL query to achieve the following:

-- Retrieve the first_name and last_name of patients.
-- The query should only select patients whose weight is within the range of 100 to 120 (inclusive).

-- Key Concepts
-- SQLite: A C-language library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesn’t require a separate server process.
-- SQL SELECT Statement: Used to select data from a database and fetch the result table. The result can be stored in a table or used as it is.
-- SQL WHERE Clause: Used to filter the results and extract only the necessary records.
-- BETWEEN Operator: In SQL, the BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set based on a range. It can be used with numbers, text and even dates.
-- Remember, it's essential to practice and test your queries to ensure accuracy. Good luck!

-- SOLUTION:- 

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients WHERE weight BETWEEN 100 and 120
